# Face condition analyzer

A Flutter application that uses real-time facial recognition to detect and analyze emotions from the device's camera.


- **Real-time emotion detection** using device camera
- **Mood tracking** with confidence levels
- **Lighting condition analysis** for optimal detection
- **History view** to track emotional patterns over time
- **Advanced metrics** showing face condition, confidence, and processing rate
- **Beautiful UI** with mood-specific colors and animations
